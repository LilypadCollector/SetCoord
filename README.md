# SetCoord

The days of recording world coordinates with pen and paper are over. SetCoord offers a convenient way for players to log and view Minecraft coordinates using simple commands. Anything goes: your home base, your girlfriend's base, that one dark oak forest for farming wood, villages, dungeon spawners, and more.
